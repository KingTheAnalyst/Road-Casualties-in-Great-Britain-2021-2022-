## Project Overview
This project analyzes road accident data in Britain from 2021 to 2022, focusing on different aspects of road casualties. The goal is to provide insights into the number of casualties, their severity, and various contributing factors such as vehicle type, road surface conditions, and area type (rural or urban). The findings are presented through a dashboard for clear visualization and decision-making.

## Objectives
1. **Identify Key Trends**: Track the number of casualties over time, with monthly and yearly comparisons.
2. **Categorize Casualties by Severity**: Understand the breakdown of accidents based on their severity (fatal, serious, and slight).
3. **Analyze Contributing Factors**: Explore how vehicle types, road conditions, and environmental factors contribute to accidents.
4. **Compare Urban vs Rural Areas**: Highlight differences in accident patterns between rural and urban areas.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains accident-related information, including:
- **Casualty Severity**: Categorized into fatal, serious, and slight.
- **Vehicle Type**: Types of vehicles involved in accidents such as cars, buses, motorcycles, vans, and others.
- **Road Type**: Type of road where accidents occurred (e.g., single carriageway, dual carriageway, roundabout).
- **Road Surface Condition**: Conditions like dry, wet, and icy.
- **Area Type**: Indicates whether the accident occurred in a rural or urban area.
- **Light Conditions**: Whether the accident occurred in daylight or darkness.

The dataset covers:
- **Total Casualties**: 417,883 across the two years.
- **Yearly Casualty Breakdown**: Detailed trends of accidents per month in both 2021 and 2022.

## Analysis Process
1. **KPI (Key Performance Indicators) Analysis**:
   - **Fatal Casualties**: Accidents that resulted in fatalities (7,135).
   - **Serious Casualties**: Accidents leading to serious injuries (5,931).
   - **Slight Casualties**: Minor injuries (351,436).
   - **Casualties by Vehicle Type**: Cars accounted for the highest number of casualties (333,485).
2. **Monthly Trends**: A comparison of monthly casualties for 2021 and 2022, showing a slight decline with a peak during summer months.
3. **Accident Distribution by Road and Area Type**:
   - **Road Type**: Most accidents occurred on single-carriageways.
   - **Area**: Urban areas had a significantly higher number of accidents (255.9K) compared to rural areas (162.0K).
4. **Road Surface and Light Conditions**:
   - Most accidents occurred on dry roads (66.9%).
   - A majority took place during daylight (305K).

The final report provides an interactive overview of the key metrics. Users can filter by year and area to explore the data in detail. Key components of the dashboard include:
1. **Total Casualties**: Displays the overall number of casualties.
2. **Severity Breakdown**: The percentage of accidents resulting in fatal, serious, and slight casualties.
3. **Vehicle Type Breakdown**: Casualties involving different vehicle types.
4. **Monthly Casualty Trend**: A line chart comparing monthly casualty counts for 2021 and 2022.
5. **Road Type and Surface Condition**: Distribution of accidents across road types and surface conditions.
6. **Area and Light Conditions**: Accidents across rural vs. urban areas and daylight vs. dark conditions.

## Key Insights
1. **Urban Areas Have More Accidents**: Likely due to higher population density and traffic.
2. **Single Carriageways are the Most Dangerous**: Suggesting a need for more safety measures.
3. **Dry Roads are Not Necessarily Safe**: Accidents still occur frequently on dry roads.
4. **Seasonal Trends**: Casualties peak in summer, possibly due to increased holiday travel.

## Recommendations
- **Focus on Urban Areas**: Prioritize road safety initiatives in urban areas.
- **Improve Safety on Single Carriageways**: Implement speed controls and better signage.
- **Driver Awareness Programs**: Educate drivers about risks, especially during daylight hours.
